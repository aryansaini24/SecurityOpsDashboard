  - Malware detection
  - DDoS attacks
  - SQL injection attempts
  - Insider threats
  - And more...
- Complete event metadata (IPs, systems, timestamps, status)

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+** installed on your system
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryansaini24/SecurityOpsDashboard.git
cd SecurityOpsDashboard
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install Flask and required Python packages:

```bash
pip install flask
```

Or use a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install flask
```

### Step 3: Verify Files

Ensure all required files are present:

```
SecurityOpsDashboard/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                    # Flask backend application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security_events.json      # Sample security event data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard.html            # Frontend interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # This file
```

## üé¨ Launch Instructions

### Starting the Dashboard

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd SecurityOpsDashboard
```

2. **Start the Flask server:**

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Starting Security Operations Dashboard...
Dashboard available at: http://localhost:5000
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

3. **Access the dashboard:**

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

4. **View real-time threat data:**

The dashboard will automatically load and display:
- Summary statistics (total events, counts by severity)
- Prioritized security events list
- Detailed threat information for each event

### Stopping the Server

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Flask is running.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Dashboard Interface

**Statistics Cards (Top Section):**
- **Total Events**: Overall count of security incidents
- **Critical**: High-priority threats requiring immediate attention
- **High Priority**: Significant threats needing quick response
- **Medium Priority**: Notable events for investigation
- **Low Priority**: Informational or minor events

**Security Events List:**
- Each event displays:
  - Event type and current status
  - Priority badge (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - Detailed description
  - Event ID and threat classification
  - Source and destination IP addresses
  - Affected systems
  - Timestamp

**Refresh Button:**
- Manual refresh to reload latest data
- Auto-refresh occurs every 30 seconds

### API Endpoints

#### Get All Events (Prioritized)
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/events
```
Returns: JSON array of security events sorted by priority

#### Get Statistics
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/stats
```
Returns: JSON object with aggregated threat statistics

#### Health Check
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/health
```
Returns: System health status and timestamp

## üîß Customization

### Adding Your Own Security Events

Edit `security_events.json` to add custom events:

```json
{
  "id": "EVT-XXX",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T12:00:00Z",
  "event_type": "Your Event Type",
  "severity": "critical",
  "threat_type": "Threat Classification",
  "source_ip": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
  "destination_ip": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
  "description": "Event description",
  "affected_systems": ["SYSTEM-01"],
  "status": "active"
}
```

### Modifying Prioritization Logic

Edit the `prioritize_incidents()` function in `app.py` to adjust:
- Base severity scores
- Threat type weightings
- Priority thresholds
- Sorting criteria

### Customizing the UI

Modify `dashboard.html` to change:
- Color schemes and styling
- Layout and grid configurations
- Auto-refresh intervals
- Data visualization formats

## üîê Security Considerations

This is a **prototype/demonstration** application. For production use, consider:

- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Adding HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Securing API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Database integration instead of JSON files
- Logging and audit trails
- Error handling and monitoring

## üì¶ Technologies Used
